You need to download posts from the collection that will be selected in the drop-down menu (Select).
At the time of downloading, but only if no posts are currently displayed, the text "Downloading data ..." should appear instead of the list of posts.
At the time of download, when posts are displayed, they should fade a bit.
Pressing the Refresh button should download the currently selected collection.
You should see a message when your posts were last downloaded.
